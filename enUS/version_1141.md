# V1.1.4.1 Hotfix 1

_**Note for Translators:**_ <br>
There were a few text updates in _Tags_Items.txt_, _Tags_Skills.txt_, _TagsGDX1_Skills.txt_, _TagsGDX1_UI.txt_, _Tags_UIMain.txt_ and in _Conversations/NPC_BonusItems_02.cnv_.

**[Major New Features]** <br>
* Loyalty pays off! Owners of the Loyalist Item Pack #2 should speak to Lancel the Knight to embrace a darker form of wizardry…
* Vendors now feature a Search Bar, which will highlight their wares based on your parameters.
* The Smuggler UI has been updated with more clear visual distinctions between the Personal and Shared Stashes.
* In addition, for owners of Ashes of Malmouth, a new button has been added to the Smuggler which automatically transfers all Components from your inventory into your currently open Stash page and combines them with any existing stacks.
* Lastly for the Smuggler, the Auto-Sort button now requires confirmation.
* New Interface Options have been added to toggle health bars over your own character, over pets and whether monster health bars should be always visible.

**[Crucible]** <br>
* Adjusted Monster damage at Waves 151+
* Reduced Health on select vanilla Boss Encounters, particularly those found in Waves 130+.

**[Art]** <br>
* Updated the Target HUD to be less obtrusive and the font tighter.

**[Animation]** <br>
* Minor adjustments to female idle pose.

**[Tech]** <br>
* Fixed strict path checking for movement skills with a gamepad.
* Auto picked up Components now combine silently.
* Fixed a crash with Aegis of Menhir.
* Added support for right click to clear search boxes.
* Fixed locked object names becoming off center when using UI scale.
* Fixed not being able to use the gamepad analog stick to change pages at the Transmuter.

**[Game]** <br>
* Reduced Monster Health and Damage on Normal Difficulty.
* Reduced Monster Health at levels 1-15 on Veteran Difficulty.
* Reduced Resistances at low levels for Zombies with exceptionally high resists (ex. Rotting Emberguards). These enemies are highly resistant to particular damage types, which can be difficult to counter at the start of the game.
* Monsters, in particular Bosses, are no longer highly resistant to Energy Leech effects.
* Components that come from crafting can no longer drop from any source (ex. quest rewards or bounties). In addition, any Partial Components left over from the v1.1.4.0 changes which can no longer be completed (as no partial drops exist) have automatically been upgraded to Complete Components.
* Kilrian’s Shattered Soul is now a little less shattered and drops Complete. Drop rate reduced, but overall this is a net buff to acquiring this rare component.
